### Getting Started

This section explains how to set up and run DAYWON on your local machine for development or testing.

#### Prerequisites

Here’s what you’ll need before you can install DAYWON:

- **Python 3.x**

    - Verify installation: 
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
- **Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
    - You can create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      ```

    - Make sure pip is installed:
      ```bash
      pip --version
      ```

    ```

- **PostgreSQL**  
    The application uses PostgreSQL for the database, so ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to install it.

- **GPT API**  
    You need to acquire the GPT API key from OpenAI’s GPT website and configure it in the application.
